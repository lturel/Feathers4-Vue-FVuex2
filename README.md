# Feathers 4 – Vue – Feathers-Vuex 3.x – Vuetify 

This project  is prepared to provide an example of new Feathers 4 on server side and utilization of Feathers-Vuex 2.0 on the client side.
Server side can be generated by standard “feathers g app” command. Authentication is included.
All the options are default values creating NeDB storage. Be careful to use latest @feathers/cli version.

Base of client side can be generated vue-cli (v3 or later) and adding Vuetify.

Related to Feathers-Vuex2.0,  the guiding given in issues [#216](https://github.com/feathers-plus/feathers-vuex/pull/216) and [#266](https://github.com/feathers-plus/feathers-vuex/issues/266) are applied. Or simply refer to latest info on [https://vuex.feathersjs.com/].

For client side, inspiration comes from  [Coding Garden with CJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGPfCT5dDQE&list=PLM_i0obccy3sv9jbUKBKojBHDMIZO8IhQ),  

Project includes Login, SignUp, Logout and access to secret pages after successful login.

Hope resultant project is helpful for a starting point.
